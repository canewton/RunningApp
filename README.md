# Introduction

The project uses React Native and is written in Javascript. The pupose of this project is to create a running app for track and field athletes that is available on Android and Apple mobile phones. The app would aid runners in their workouts by displaying the amount of time it takes for them to run a certain distance. Data regarding an athlete's workout is sent from a physical device, attached to the athlete's shoe, to this app.
